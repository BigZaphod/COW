Alex van Oostenrijk and Martijn van Beek have written a paper which analyzes the semantics of COW.
The study is available in both <a href="semantics-cow-dutch.pdf">Dutch</a> and
<a href="semantics-cow-english.pdf">English</a>.  They show a proof that COW is Turing-complete.
Check it out today!

<p>
The COW programming language was designed with the bovine in mind. Given that cows have 
 somewhat limited vocabulary skills, it seemed natural to incorporate only the words they
 know into the language.  As a result, all instructions are some variation on "moo" which
 just so happens to be the only word they really understand.
</p>
<p>
Any other word or symbol that isn't an instruction is ignored entirely.  So, spaces can
 be used or not.  Newlines can be used or not.  You get the idea.  It makes commenting
 COW programs rather easy as long as you don't use any words that have an instruction
 embedded in it.  <b>All instructions are case-sensitive.</b>
</p>

The commands are as follows:
<br><br>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="4">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="black" nowrap><font color="white">Code</font></td>
<td bgcolor="black" nowrap><font color="white">Instruction</font></td>
<td bgcolor="black" width="100%"><font color="white">Description</font></td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>0</td>
<td>moo</td>
<td>This command is connected to the MOO command.  When encountered during normal execution,
 it searches the program code in reverse looking for a matching MOO command and begins
 executing again starting from the found MOO command.  When searching, it skips the instruction
 that is immediately before it (see MOO).</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>1</td>
<td>mOo</td>
<td>Moves current memory position back one block.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>2</td>
<td>moO</td>
<td>Moves current memory position forward one block.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>3</td>
<td>mOO</td>
<td>Execute value in current memory block as if it were an instruction.  The command executed is based on the
 instruction code value (for example, if the current memory block contains a 2, then the moO command is executed).
 An invalid command exits the running program.  Value 3 is invalid as it would cause an infinite loop.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>4</td>
<td>Moo</td>
<td>If current memory block has a 0 in it, read a single ASCII character from STDIN and store it in the
 current memory block.  If the current memory block is not 0, then print the ASCII character that corresponds
 to the value in the current memory block to STDOUT.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>5</td>
<td>MOo</td>
<td>Decrement current memory block value by 1.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>6</td>
<td>MoO</td>
<td>Increment current memory block value by 1.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>7</td>
<td>MOO</td>
<td>If current memory block value is 0, skip next command and resume execution <b>after</b> the next matching moo command.
 If current memory block value is not 0, then continue with next command. <b>Note that the fact that it skips the
 command immediately following it has interesting ramifications for where the matching moo command really
 is.  For example, the following will match the second and not the first moo:  OOO MOO moo moo</b></td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>8</td>
<td>OOO</td>
<td>Set current memory block value to 0.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>9</td>
<td>MMM</td>
<td>If no current value in register, copy current memory block value.  If there is a value in the register,
 then paste that value into the current memory block and clear the register.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>10</td>
<td>OOM</td>
<td>Print value of current memory block to STDOUT as an integer.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>11</td>
<td>oom</td>
<td>Read an integer from STDIN and put it into the current memory block.</td>
</tr>

<b>SOURCE</b><br><br>
Now that you're all pumped up to get your neighborhood cows in on the action,
 you can download and compile the C++ <a href="http://github.com/BigZaphod/COW/tree/master/source/cow.cpp">interpreter source</a> or
 my new <a href="http://github.com/BigZaphod/COW/tree/master/source/cowcomp.cpp">compiler</a> that generates a C++ version of the COW
 source.  Enjoy!
<br><br>
Forget how many bottles of beer you had on the wall?  <a href="http://www.slarty.org">Slarty</a>
 has contributed a <a href="http://github.com/BigZaphod/COW/tree/master/examples/99.cow">program to help</a>.  Enjoy.

<a href="http://github.com/BigZaphod/COW/tree/master/source/cow.k">Here is a COW interpreter</a> written in the

<b>NOTICE:</b> Bovine Programming Reseach has contributed a revolutionary new extension to COW
 they are calling Distributed Digestion eXtentions (DDX).  This enhancement allows bovines everywhere
 to better utilize the hardware they were born with.  Read more about DDX <a href="https://raw.github.com/BigZaphod/COW/master/ddx/ddx.txt">here</a>.
 Grab the <a href="http://github.com/BigZaphod/COW/tree/master/ddx/cow.cpp">code</a> and increase your productivity today!  BPR also provided two
 sample DDX applications to get you started:  <a href="http://github.com/BigZaphod/COW/tree/master/ddx/fib-ddx.cow">Fibonacci numbers with DDX</a> and 
 <a href="http://github.com/BigZaphod/COW/tree/master/ddx/pow7-ddx.cow">Powers of 7</a>.  Thanks BPR!

Frank Buss implemented <a href="http://www.frank-buss.de/cow.html">COW in Javascript</a>. Check it out if that's your language of choice. (I'm a fan, myself.)

Amirreza Ipchi-e-Haq ported <a href="https://github.com/Amirreza-Ipchi-Haq/COW">COW to pure C</a> for those times when you don't have a C++ compiler handy.

<br><br>
<b>History</b><br><br>
Although I don't quite remember for sure, I believe COW was released sometime in early 2003.
